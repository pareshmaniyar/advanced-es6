/**
 * We know that a function can access variables outside of it; this feature 
 * is used quite often. But what happens when an outer variable changes?
 * Does a function get the most recent value or the one that 
 * existed when the function was created?
 * 
 * what happens when a function travels to another place in the code and 
 * is called from there â€“ does it get access to the outer variables of the 
 * new place?
