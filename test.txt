JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator.

Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had

relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities,

server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit

niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California

and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days,

realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications

expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities,

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have

browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have
been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.//wiki
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also 
characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of 
the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is 
an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use 
it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming 
styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself
does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Beginnings at Netscape
In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the 
first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in 
expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP 
niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a 
company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California
and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic 
Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The 
internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for 
"Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the
world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, 
Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had 
already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web 
browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, 
the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and 
the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications 
realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the 
founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was 
easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components 
such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the 
Web page markup.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of 
embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. 
Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun 
Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming 
language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web 
technologies and platforms.[12] Netscape Communications then decided that the 
scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have
a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, 
Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, 
in May 1995.

Server-side JavaScript
In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape 
introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with 
Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of 
server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.
